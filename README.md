# Vehicle Classification & Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that helps in counting vehicles separately as cars, trucks, bikes, and more. Future updates will enhance its functionality to make it even more useful.

## Features
- Detects and classifies vehicles into different categories (cars, trucks, bikes, etc.).
- Reads and processes vehicle datasets.
- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Generates statistics and visualizations.
- Implements machine learning models (if applicable).

## Future Enhancements
- Improve classification accuracy.
- Add support for more vehicle categories.
- Implement real-time vehicle detection (if applicable).
- Enhance data visualization and reporting.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- OpenCV (if using image/video processing)
- Scikit-learn (if machine learning is included)

## Contributing
If you have improvements or new features, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
